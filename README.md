## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Although this may be considered one of the simpler challenges on the platform, it was particularly challenging for me, as I hadn't worked with HTML or CSS in over two years. At times, it was frustrating, and I found myself struggling with some of the basic concepts of these technologies. However, I was able to push through, and in doing so, I not only regained my skills but also learned a few new techniques along the way. I'm excited to continue tackling more challenges to further hone my skills and get back on track.

### Continued development

I'll be going on to tackle more advanced CSS and proceed to Javascript. I'd also like to practice Bootstrap and jQuery.
